- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly interface with swipe gestures

## Search Modes

### 1. Global Search

Search across all available podcast episodes to find the most relevant content for your query.

**Use Cases:**

- Finding specific advice or insights across multiple episodes
- Discovering episodes that cover particular topics
- Getting a broad overview of content related to your interests

### 2. Episode-Specific Search

Search within a specific episode to find the most relevant moments and insights.

**Use Cases:**

- Finding specific moments in an episode you're interested in
- Discovering the most popular or important segments of an episode
- Getting more targeted results when you know which episode contains what you're looking for

**How to Use:**

1. Perform a global search to find relevant episodes
2. Click "Search this episode" on any result to switch to episode-specific search
3. Enter your follow-up query to find specific moments within that episode

## API Endpoints

### `GET /api/trpc/search.search`

Unified search endpoint that handles both global and video-specific searches.

**Parameters:**

- `query`: Search query string
- `topK`: Number of results to return (default: 5)
- `videoId`: (Optional) Database ID of the video to search within. If provided, search is limited to that video.

**Examples:**

```javascript
// Global search across all episodes
await api.search.search.fetch({
  query: "startup advice",
  topK: 5,
});

// Search within a specific video
await api.search.search.fetch({
  query: "leadership tips",
  videoId: 123,
  topK: 10,
});
```

### `GET /api/trpc/search.getVideoByYoutubeId`

Get video details by YouTube ID.

**Parameters:**

- `youtubeId`: YouTube video ID

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file with:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   ```

3. **Database Setup**

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Video Download**: Downloads videos from YouTube playlists
2. **Transcription**: Uses Whisper to generate word-level timestamps
3. **Segmentation**: Creates semantic segments based on topic changes
4. **Emotion Analysis**: Analyzes emotional context of segments
5. **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector embeddings for similarity search
6. **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings in Pinecone for fast retrieval

## Search Algorithm

1. **Query Embedding**: Converts search query to vector representation
2. **Vector Search**: Finds similar segments using cosine similarity
3. **Database Filtering**: Retrieves full transcript data for timestamp-based filtering
4. **LLM Ranking**: Uses GPT-4 to rank segments by relevance
5. **Precise Seeking**: Finds exact starting points within segments
6. **Result Formatting**: Returns structured results with timestamps and transcripts
